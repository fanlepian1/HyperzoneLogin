# HyperZoneLogin

**HyperZoneLogin** is a Velocity-based authentication framework for Minecraft proxy networks.
It is designed for servers that need to support multiple login flows under one unified profile system.

## What it does

HyperZoneLogin helps you build a consistent authentication layer for a Velocity network.

- Supports multiple authentication methods in one project
- Keeps players in a controlled auth / waiting flow until authentication is complete
- Unifies profile creation, profile binding, and post-auth routing
- Can be extended with optional modules for security, migration, and skin handling

## Supported authentication methods

HyperZoneLogin currently provides these authentication modules:

| Method | Module | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Local / Offline accounts | `auth-offline` | Register, log in, change password, unregister, email recovery, optional short sessions, and optional TOTP 2FA |
| Yggdrasil authentication | `auth-yggd` | Authenticate with Mojang-style or compatible Yggdrasil services, including configurable multiple entries |
| Floodgate / Bedrock authentication | `auth-floodgate` | Recognize Floodgate players and treat Bedrock access as a trusted authentication channel |

In other words, the project is suitable for networks that need one or more of the following:

- classic offline/local account login
- Yggdrasil-based premium or custom online authentication
- Bedrock player access through Floodgate / Geyser setups

## Optional modules

Besides authentication, the repository also includes several supporting modules:

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `safe` | Entry-layer protection such as rate limiting, abnormal name checks, and temporary cooldowns |
| `data-merge` | Migration tools for importing data from older systems such as MinecraftLink / legacy ML and AuthMe |
| `profile-skin` | Skin extraction, repair, caching, and profile skin application for authenticated profiles |
